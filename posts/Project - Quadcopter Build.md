Quadcopters are something I've been interested in for some time, when I first saw one I was amazed by the agility and stability it displayed and immediately wanted to know more. Being a programmer, the fact that carefully designed control software is the only thing that allows quadcopters to stay in the air furthered my interest. Since then I've bought a couple of cheap RC quadcopters, which I've had a lot of fun flying.

Another thing that appealed to me about quadcopters and multirotors in general is that as of recent years, it has become very easy for a hobbyist to put together one of his own fairly cheaply using standardised hardware and electronics. After having some experience of flying the aforementioned cheaper ready-to-fly quadcopters, I decided to take my hobby to the next level and do exactly this, build a much larger quadcopter from hobby-grade parts.

A large portion of my interest and knowledge of multicopters and RC comes from [Flite Test](http://www.youtube.com/user/flitetest/), an excellent YouTube channel that creates high-quality videos about all aspects of RC and has entertained me a great deal. They also run a [website](http://flitetest.com) for hobbyists to share their knowledge and projects. FliteTest have their own range of RC aeroplane and multirotor frame kits, and my quad is based around their Rotor Bones series of frames.

The Rotor Bones Anycopter frames consist of 3, 4, 6 or 8 (depending on the desired multicopter) wooden booms with black delrin landing gear connected to a circular hub. In my case I'm building a quadcopter so I'll be using 4 booms, but a benefit of this frame is that if at some point I decide I want a hexacopter or octocopter, all I need to do is add more booms and parts to the existing frame. When assembled, the frame looks very sturdy and rather nice.

After a few weeks waiting for all my electronics to be in stock on HobbyKing, they were shipped and arrived. For those unfamiliar with multirotors, this consisted of a lithium polymer battery, motors, propellers, speed controllers (ESCs) to drive the motors and a control board to act as the brain of the copter. I already had a radio transmitter and receiver to control the quad. For those interested, here is a listing of my parts:

*HobbyKing KK2.0 Multi-rotor Flight Control Board
*Turnigy 2200mAh 3S 20C LiPo Battery
*Turnigy Aerodrive SK3 2822 1275Kv Brushless Motors
*Turnigy Multistar 15A ESCs
*8045 SF Propellers

For those familiar with building custom PCs, assembling a multirotor is not too different. You pick out your parts, order them, wait for them to arrive and then connect them up, with a small risk of destroying something if you get it wrong. You may need a few more tools to put together a quadcopter than a PC, though.
