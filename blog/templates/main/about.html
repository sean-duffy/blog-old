				<p>
          I'm <strong>Sean</strong>. Originally from Liverpool, I'm a third year Computer Science student at
          the University of York.
				</p>
				<p>
          I'm interested in programming and web development - at the moment I'm working mostly in Python and JavaScript.
          You can see examples of some things I've made on the <a href='/projects/'>projects</a> page and on my
          <a href='http://www.github.com/sean-duffy' target='_blank'>GitHub profile</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
          I have a small collection of vintage computers, which you can see and read about in
          <a href='http://www.seanduffy.co.uk/blog/2013/7/Vintage-Computer-Collection/'>this</a>
          post. I also have an affection for all things that fly under remote control, mostly quadcopters,
          and I like building and flying them in my spare time.
				</p>
				<p>
          Besides that I also enjoy electronics, physics and playing the guitar or occasionally piano. 
          I like to read classic science fiction and fantasy as well as biographies and historical books.
