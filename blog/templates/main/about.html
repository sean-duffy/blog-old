				<h2 id='noLink'>About</h2>
				<p>
					I'm <strong>Sean</strong>. I'm currently 18 years old and in my final year of sixth form in Liverpool, England. If all goes well I'll be studying a degree in Computer Science at the University of York in September this year.
				</p>
				<p>
					I'm interested in programming and web development - at the moment I'm working mostly in Python and Java. You can see examples of some things I've made on the <a href='/projects/'>projects</a> page, or at least you will be able to when I get around to adding to it.
				</p>
				<p>
					I have a keen interest in the history of computers and I've amassed a small collection of 
					vintage computers, which consists of a Commodore 64, TI-99/4A, BBC Micro and Commodore PET 3032 series. I've also recently developed an affection for all things that fly under remote control, mostly quadcopters, and I like tinkering with and flying those in my spare time.
				</p>
				<p>
					Besides theat I also enjoy electronics, physics and playing the guitar or occasionally piano.
					I like to read classic science fiction as well as biographies and historical books.
