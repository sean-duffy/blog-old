			<h2>Personal Profile</h2>
			<p>
				I am an 18 year old sixth form student currently studying A-Levels at the Liverpool Blue Coat School. My main interests are computer science and electronics and my hobbies include flying RC aircraft and playing the guitar.
			</p>
			<p>
				I have a keen interest in technology and enjoy learning about both software and hardware, as well as the interaction between them. For this reason I have studied programming and electronics both in my sixth form education and in my own time using books and online resources.
			</p>
			<p>
				I have built some of my own small software and hardware projects using programming and electronic components as well as projects which combine both software and hardware using devices such as the electronics prototyping platform 'Arduino'. One example of a software project is my personal website and blog, which I have provided the address of in the header of this document.
			<p>
				I believe I am motivated, determined and able to adapt to a multitude of different applications. I am always ready to learn new skills or apply my current knowledge and expertise to new situations. I intend to study computer science at university in September.
			</p>

			<h2>Skills & Expertise</h2>
			<p>
				I have a fair amount of experience with programming in Python and some experience in Java, C# and VB.NET. I am able to develop dynamic web applications with HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, Django, PHP and SQL and often use Git for version control. Some examples of code I have written can be found on my <a href='http://www.github.com/sean-duffy'>GitHub</a> page. I also have experience programming Atmel AVR microcontrollers using the <a href='http://www.arduino.cc'>Arduino</a> electronics prototyping platform and have done some simple visual programming using <a href='http://processing.org'>Processing</a>.

			<h2>Experience</h2>

			<h3>Aquarium Software - Technical Support <span>2012</span></h3>
			<p>
				In the summer of 2012 I spent two weeks at Aquarium Software, a company which distributes a case and claims management software service called Aquarium. During the placement I had to quickly gain an understanding of the software and then use that knowledge to respond to support tickets from the clients of Aquarium, communicating effectively to solve the issues they were having.
			</p>
			<p>
				I also spent some time with the developers of Aquarium, who gave me an introduction to the technologies behind the software and allowed me to write some code in C#, a language which at the time was completely new to me. This placement was an excellent opportunity for me to experience what it is like to work at a software company.
			</p>
			
			<h3>University of Liverpool - Research Assistant <span>2012</span></h3>
			<p>
				I participated in a work experience placement in the department of Electrical Engineering and Electronics at the University of Liverpool for a duration of two weeks in 2012. In this placement, I was assigned to work with a group conducting research into the development of a rectification device capable of operating in the terahertz frequency range.
			</p>
			<p>
				During my time at this placement, I was able to gain skills such as the use of scientific optical and electrical measurement apparatus, as well as analysis of the data produced by these instruments.
			</p>

			<h3>Taskers PLC - IT Support <span>2010</span></h3>
			<p>
				I completed a two week work experience placement at the head office of Taskers PLC for two weeks in 2010. During these two weeks, I was able to experience work in an office environment, and apply my IT knowledge to solve problems and carry out tasks assigned to me. This included installing software, configuring new computers, setting up new pieces of hardware, updating device firmware and many other tasks.
			</p>
			<p>
				Aled Morgan, my supervisor during my work experience, made the following comment of my performance during the placement:
			</p>
			<blockquote>
				"Sean was a very keen member of the IT department during his work experience and was proactive in looking for tasks to complete. I found him to be a very polite and punctual young man with excellent communication skills all of which will serve him well for his future career in IT."
			</blockquote>

			<h2>Additional Information</h2>
			<p>
				During my time at Broadgreen International School I was appointed as a member of the school council, which held fortnightly meeting to discuss matters concerning different aspects of the school. I attended several events and conferences outside of school as part of the school council, including a trip to the Liverpool Youth Courts and a conference in Chorely about the 'Building Schools for the Future' project.
			</p>
			<p>
				I was a member of the Scouts for ten years and was awarded the Chief Scout's Diamond Award, the second highest award
				available in the Explorer Scout section.
			</p>
			<p>
				I was selected to be a prefect in the Liverpool Blue Coat School, which means I was given extra responsibilities and duties including supervising rooms at lunchtime and ensuring the behaviour of younger students, as well as attending after school events such as open days.
			</p>
