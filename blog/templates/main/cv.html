			<h2>Personal Profile</h2>
			<p>
                I am a 19 year old student studying Computer Systems and Software Engineering (MEng) at the University of York.
                My main interests are programming and electronics and my hobbies include flying RC aircraft and playing the guitar.
			</p>
			<p>
                I have a keen interest in technology and enjoy learning about both software and hardware, as well as the interaction
                between them. For this reason I have studied programming and electronics both in my education and in my own time using
                books and online resources.
			</p>
			<p>
                I have built some of my own small software and hardware projects using programming and electronic components as well as
                projects which combine both software and hardware using devices such as the 'Raspberry Pi' and 'Arduino'. One example of
                a software project is my personal website and blog, which I have provided the address of in the header of this document.
			<p>
                I believe I am motivated, determined and able to adapt to a multitude of different applications. I am always ready to
                learn new skills or apply my current knowledge and expertise to new situations. I intend to follow a career in a
                computer related discipline.
			</p>

			<h2>Skills &amp; Expertise</h2>
			<p>
                I have a considerable amount of experience with programming in Python, Java and Ruby and some experience in Bash, C#
                and VB.NET. I am able to develop dynamic web applications with HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, Django, PHP and SQL and often
                use Git for version control. Some examples of code I have written can be found on my
                <a href='http://www.github.com/sean-duffy'>GitHub</a> page. I also have experience programming Atmel AVR micro-controllers
                using the <a href='http://www.arduino.cc'>Arduino</a> electronics prototyping platform and have done some simple visual
                programming using <a href='http://processing.org'>Processing</a>.

			<h2>Experience</h2>

			<h3>ScraperWiki - Software Development <span>2013</span></h3>
			<p>
                During the summer of 2013 I had a sixth week internship at ScraperWiki. ScraperWiki is a data-science
                startup specialising in the extraction, cleaning and analysis of data, which they provide via their
                self-service online platform or as a managed service for professional organisations.
			</p>
			<p>
                During my internship at ScraperWiki I wrote web scraping tools for the online platform which used Python
                and Regular Expressions for the backend, and JavaScript, HTML and CSS for the frontend. I was also involved
                in work on the platform itself. ScraperWiki follows the principles of Agile Software Development and Extreme
                Programming, so I participated in pair programming, stand-up meetings and retrospectives during my internship.
			</p>

			<h3>Aquarium Software - Technical Support <span>2012</span></h3>
			<p>
                In the summer of 2012 I spent two weeks at Aquarium Software, a company which distributes a case and claims
                management software service called Aquarium. During the placement I had to quickly gain an understanding of
                the software and then use that knowledge to respond to support tickets from the clients of Aquarium, communicating
                effectively to solve the issues they were having
			</p>
			<p>
                I also spent some time with the developers of Aquarium, who gave me an introduction to the technologies behind
                the software and allowed me to write some code in C#, a language which at the time was completely new to me.
                This placement was an excellent opportunity for me to experience what it is like to work at a software company.
			</p>
			
			<h3>University of Liverpool - Research Assistant <span>2012</span></h3>
			<p>
                I participated in a work experience placement in the department of Electrical Engineering and Electronics at
                the University of Liverpool for a duration of two weeks in 2012. In this placement, I was assigned to work
                with a group conducting research into the development of a rectification device capable of operating in the
                terahertz frequency range.
			</p>
			<p>
                During my time at this placement, I was able to gain skills such as the use of scientific optical and electrical 
                measurement apparatus, as well as analysis of the data produced by these instruments.
			</p>

			<h3>Taskers PLC - IT Support <span>2010</span></h3>
			<p>
                I completed a two week work experience placement at the head office of Taskers PLC for two weeks in 2010. During
                these two weeks, I was able to experience work in an office environment, and apply my IT knowledge to solve problems
                and carry out tasks assigned to me. This included installing software, configuring new computers, setting up new pieces
                of hardware, updating device firmware and many other tasks.
			</p>
			<p>
				Aled Morgan, my supervisor during my work experience, made the following comment of my performance during the placement:
			</p>
			<blockquote>
                "Sean was a very keen member of the IT department during his work experience and was proactive in looking for tasks to
                complete. I found him to be a very polite and punctual young man with excellent communication skills all of which will
                serve him well for his future career in IT."
			</blockquote>

			<h2>Additional Information</h2>
			<p>
                During my time at Broadgreen International School I was appointed as a member of the school council, which held fortnightly 
                meeting to discuss matters concerning different aspects of the school. I attended several events and conferences outside of 
                school as part of the school council, including a trip to the Liverpool Youth Courts and a conference in Chorely about the 
                'Building Schools for the Future' project.
			</p>
			<p>
				I was a member of the Scouts for ten years and was awarded the Chief Scout's Diamond Award, the second highest award
				available in the Explorer Scout section.
			</p>
			<p>
                I was selected to be a prefect in the Liverpool Blue Coat School, which means I was given extra responsibilities and
                duties including supervising rooms at lunchtime and ensuring the behaviour of younger students, as well as attending after
                school events such as open days.
